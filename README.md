- Part 2: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/37
    - [x] 1. Building a list we can delete from
    - [x] 2. Working with Identifiable items in SwiftUI
    - [x] 3. Sharing an observed object with a new view
    - [x] 4. Making changes permanent with UserDefaults

- Part 3: Challenges: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/iexpense-wrap-up
    - [x] 1. Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.
    - [ ] 2. Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.
    - [x] 3. For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!
            - I think it works? Not sure how to properly test this.
